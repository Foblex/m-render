# Connection Markers

## Description

This guide shows how to set up different [connection markers](./docs/f-connection-marker-directive), allowing various markers to be displayed on connections between connectors. To enable this feature, you need to add an SVG element with the [f-connection-marker directive](./docs/f-connection-marker-directive) inside the 
[f-connection component](./docs/f-connection-component). 

## Example

::: ng-component <connection-markers></connection-markers> [height]="600"
